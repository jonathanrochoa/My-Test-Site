    <img src="images/main-image.png" alt="Jonathan Ochoa's Picture">
    <p>Hello, My name is Jonathan Ochoa and I am excited to be a part of Digital Crafts!</p>

    <p>I live in Cartersville, GA with my wife Carolina and my 4-year old dog named Coco.</p>
    <p>I am currently a sales administrator for a mat manufacturing company in Calhoun, GA but am looking to start a new journey to becoming a web developer through Digital Crafts.</p>
    <p>These are a few of the things I enjoy the most:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Watching/Playing Soccer</li>
      <li>Gaming - mostly FPS games</li>
      <li>Drumming</li>
      <li>Attending ATL UTD matches</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I have a Bachelors in Business Administration - Marketing but after finishing Digital Crafts I would love to work using my new coding skills in addition to my sales and business background.</p>
